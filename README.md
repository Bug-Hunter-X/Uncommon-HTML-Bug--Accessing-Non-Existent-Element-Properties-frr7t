# Uncommon HTML Bug: Accessing Non-Existent Element Properties

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where attempting to access a non-existent property of an HTML element might not throw an error but can lead to unexpected behavior.  This is particularly subtle because it doesn't result in a typical runtime exception. Instead, the behavior depends heavily on the browser's implementation.

**Problem:**  Modern browsers handle the access of a non-existent property in a non-standardized way, sometimes returning `undefined` without throwing errors. This can make debugging challenging, as it won't immediately signal an obvious error.

**Solution:** Thoroughly validate the existence of properties and check for `undefined` before attempting to use them.
